# Hoi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rayo, he/they, CTO @voxsio, Treasurer @Prewired, ex-Cognitive Science at the University of Edinburgh.

At Voxsio we work on ethical and conversational digital health apps. Currently, our main focus is UB-OK, our app supporting young people with functional gastrointestinal disorders and comorbid mental health issues, created in close collaboration with NHS Grampian and delivered through our bespoke chatbot building platform Botany. Beyond such topics as designing for mental health and AI for social good I'm more broadly interested in such things as embodied cognition, psycholinguistics, design informatics, educational technology, and web tech.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you feel like it!
