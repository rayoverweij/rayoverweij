# Hoi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rayo, he/they, a Cog Sci grad at the University of Edinburgh.

I like to think about education, coding, and language, and how they come together; the way we think and learn about things, and how technology can influence that. Sometimes I build something that touches on these fields, usually in React or Kotlin, and when I do, it will probably end up here.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you see anything interesting!
