# Hoi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rayo, he/they, CTO at UB-OK, ex-Cognitive Science at the University of Edinburgh.

My work tends to live somewhere between computer science, cognitive neuroscience, and linguistics, bridging academic thought with real-world implementations, always for the public good. Currently @ub-ok, I'm exploring intelligent conversational software for mental health applications. In general, my stack includes web apps with React/TypeScript, mobile apps with React Native or sometimes native Kotlin/Java on Android, scripting with Python, and NLU with RASA. 

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you see anything interesting!
