# Hoi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rayo, he/they, a PhD Student on the Centre for Doctoral Training in Designing Responsible NLP at the University of Edinburgh.

My work focuses on the use of AI in schools and specifically how to involve students themselves in the processes of design and development of the NLP-based tools that are being built for their education. I'm also a trustee of Prewired, an Edinburgh charity that runs an after-school coding club for young people, and in a previous life was the CTO of Voxsio, a start-up building ethical conversational digital health apps in collaboration with NHS Scotland.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you feel like it!
